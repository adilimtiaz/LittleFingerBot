   "Don’t tell anyone, I have a reputation to maintain",
   "Distrusting me was the wisest thing you’ve done since you climbed off your horse",
   "Brothels make a much better investment than ships I’ve found. Whores rarely sink",
   "I learnt that I’ll never win. Not that way. That’s their game, their rules. I’m not going to fight them, I’m going to fuck them. That’s what I know, that’s what I am. And only by admitting what we are can we get what we want",
   "Only if we lose",
   "You must be one of the few men in the city who isn’t a man",
   "Look around you. We’re all liars here – and every one of us is better than you",
   "Chaos isn’t a pit. Chaos is a ladder. Many who try to climb it fail, and never get to try again. The fall breaks them. And some are given a chance to climb, but they refuse. They cling to the realm, or the gods, or love – illusions. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is",
   "PLEASE SANSA!",
   "Ah, the Starks. Quick tempers, slow minds.",
   "We both peddle fantasies…mine just happen to be entertaining.",
   "Look around you. We’re all liars here.",
   "The past is gone for good. You can sit here mourning it’s departure, or prepare for the future.",
   "I warned you not to trust me.",
   "Money buys a man's silence for a time. A bolt in the heart buys it forever."
